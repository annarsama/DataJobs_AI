This project is part of an educative course on text mining from the Master 2 SISE (Universit√© Lyon 2). This is a **Streamlit-based job offer application featuring interactive visualizations and chatbot/Q&amp;A bots powered by MistralAI Mixtral-8x7B LLM, with offers stored in a SQLite data warehouse and containerized using Docker.**

## Description
## The folders

The first folder (link) represents the application with the LLM-based agents and the Streamlit front-end. There is also the necessary to create a virtual environment with dependencies and the Docker image of the application.

The second folder (link) represents the extraction, transformation (cleaning/normalisation of the different columns and feature engineering) and then the loading into a data warehouse created with SQLite. 

The third folder includes the web scrapping files for the job-offers.
