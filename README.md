This is the final project for our natural language processing course from the Master 2 SISE (Universit√© Lyon 2). This is a **Streamlit-based job offer application featuring interactive visualizations and chatbot/Q&amp;A bots powered by MistralAI Mixtral-8x7B LLM, with offers stored in a SQLite data warehouse and containerized using Docker.** We have removed the database from the repository so as not to disseminate information from these websites. 

This project was made by **Naomi KALDJOB**, **Annabelle NARSAMA**, et **Clovis VARANGOT-REILLE**.

## Description
## The folders

The [first folder](https://github.com/cvarrei/DataJobs_AI/tree/main/Application) includes the front-end application files with the LLM-based agents and the Streamlit front-end. There is also the necessary to create a virtual environment with dependencies and the Docker image of the application.

The [second folder](https://github.com/cvarrei/DataJobs_AI/tree/main/ETL%20%26%20DataWarehouse%20Management) represents the extraction, transformation (cleaning/normalisation of the different columns and feature engineering) and then the loading into a data warehouse created with SQLite. 

The [third folder](https://github.com/cvarrei/DataJobs_AI/tree/main/Web%20Scraping)https://github.com/cvarrei/DataJobs_AI/tree/main/Web%20Scraping includes the web scrapping files for the job-offers.
